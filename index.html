# A Prosperous Look at ReactJS

---

# The Situation

* Marionette does an incredible job of managing complex view structure

* We acknowledge the awesome abstractions that Marionette provides us as developers

* Given the requirements of the Borrower Funnel on mobile web, we'd love to introduce an alternative perspective to views: ReactJS

(brief intro)

# Virtual DOM

Each HTML element is wrapped in a ReactDOM object, keeping us from manipulating the DOM directly

![Virtual Dom](virtual_dom.png)

When data changes, React will quickly diff the current state of the UI with the desired state and compute the minimal set of DOM mutations (which are quite expensive) to achieve it

Also, the library batches together these mutations such that the UI is updated all at once in a single animation frame

---

# Perspective

From the React team:

 > "Lots of people use React as the V in MVC.
 > Since React makes no assumptions about the rest of your technology stack,
 > it's easy to try it out on a small feature in an existing project."

By default, each component is in charge of rendering itself and will re-render if data changes (from the user or from a server).

````jsx
var Rate = React.createClass({
  render: function() {
    return (
      <div className="rate">
        <h2 className="rateName">
          {this.props.name}
        </h2>
        {this.props.rate}
      </div>
    );
  }
});
````

---

# Slimmer HTML

Not necessary to define templates ahead of time in html, everything renders in a parent container

```html
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Prosper!</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="build/bootstrap.min.css">
    <script src="build/react.min.js"></script>
    <!-- <script src="build/JSXTransformer.js"></script> -->
    <script src="build/jquery-2.1.1.min.js"></script>
  </head>
  <body>
    <div class='container'>
      <div id="funnel"></div>
    </div>
    <script src='build/rateResults.js'></script>
    <script src='build/rateForm.js'></script>
    <script src='build/personalInfo.js'></script>
    <script src='build/app.js'></script>
  </body>
</html>
```

# Testable Code

Simply put, the nature of a React component makes it relatively simple to unit test.

The library provides `React.addons.ReactTestUtils`, which help mock out React components and its default behaviors

Plays well with Jasmine, Jest, Mocha, pretty much any testing framework *(according to them)*

From their docs, simulating the a click and keyDown event:

```javascript
var node = this.refs.input.getDOMNode();
React.addons.TestUtils.Simulate.click(node);
React.addons.TestUtils.Simulate.change(node);
React.addons.TestUtils.Simulate.keyDown(node, {key: "Enter"});
```

# Shortcomings of ReactJS

---

# JSX

While optional, the community typically writes React components in JSX, which are transformed into JS (either on the browser or locally built)

This means each js file needs to begin with `/** @jsx React.DOM */` in order to be transformed

You could pretty easily write with React in pure javascript, but it begins to feel strange to be combining DOM elements + js:

```javascript
var Rate = React.createClass({displayName: 'Rate',
  render: function() {
    return (
      React.DOM.div({className: "rate"},
        React.DOM.h2({className: "rateName"},
          this.props.name
        ),
        this.props.rate
      )
    );
  }
});
```

# Difficult to Debug

I needed to install a React DevTools plugin to have proper debugging in my console, which is annoying (but the consequence of not messing with the DOM directly)

# Talking Points

---

# Event System

ReactJS passes around callbacks while Marionette uses a pub/sub structure:

```jsx
var RateForm = React.createClass({
  handleSubmit: function(e) {
    //handle event here
  },
  render: function() {
    return (
      <form className='rateForm' onSubmit={this.handleSubmit}>
        <input type='number' placeholder='Loan Amount' ref='amount'/>
        <input type='text' placeholder='Loan Purpose' ref='purpose'/>
        <input type='text' placeholder='Credit Score' ref='creditScore'/>
        <input type='submit' value='Post' />
      </form>
    );
  }
});
```
VS.

````javascript
this.listenTo(BorrowerFunnel.vent, 'rate:submitted', function(response) {
  this.showRate(response);
});

BorrowerFunnel.vent.trigger('rate:submitted', response);
````

---
# Event System

ReactJS passes a `SyntheticEvent` object to each handler. `SyntheticEvent` is a cross-browser wrapper around the browser's native event.

According to the docs, it has the same interface as the browser's native event, including stopPropagation() and preventDefault(), except the events work identically across all browsers.

---

# Validations

We can use React's `mixins` concept to handle validations on the client. An example:

```jsx
var PersonalInfo = React.createClass({
  mixins: [ValidationMixin],

  validators: {
    name: function (name) {
      return name.length > 0;
    }
  },

  // ...

});
```

[See here for more information on Mixins](http://facebook.github.io/react/docs/reusable-components.html#mixins)

# Routing

For our project, we will likely need a routing solution (since users could be coming from other partner pages down the line)

We can adopt [Backbone.Router](https://medium.com/react-tutorials/react-backbone-router-c00be0cf1592) to achieve this, or use one of the many reactive routing solutions out there:

[React Router](https://github.com/rackt/react-router)

[React Router Component](https://github.com/andreypopp/react-router-component)

# An Idea

Using a combination of React and Backbone will provide a high level of maintainability for the Borrower Funnel moving forward.
